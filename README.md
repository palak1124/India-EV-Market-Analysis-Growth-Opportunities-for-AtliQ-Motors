# India-EV-Market-Analysis-Growth-Opportunities-for-AtliQ-Motors

## Project Overview

AtliQ Motors, a leading US-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, aims to expand into the Indian market where its current presence is minimal. This project evaluates India’s EV and hybrid vehicle landscape and proposes a data-backed market entry strategy for AtliQ Motors.

The analysis combines primary data analysis, secondary research, and strategic consulting frameworks to identify growth opportunities, risks, and an optimal go-to-market approach.

## Business Objective

1. To support AtliQ Motors’ leadership in making informed decisions on:

2. Which EV segments to enter (2W vs 4W)

3. Which Indian states to prioritize

4. How to structure a phased market entry

5. Where to locate manufacturing

6. How to position the brand for long-term success

## Key Questions Addressed
### Primary Analysis

1. Top & bottom EV manufacturers by sales (FY2023–FY2024)

2. EV penetration by state (2W & 4W)

3. States with declining EV adoption

4. Quarterly & seasonal sales trends

5. CAGR analysis by state and manufacturer

6. 2030 EV sales projections

7. Revenue growth estimation for EV segments

### Secondary Research

1. Key drivers of EV adoption in India

2. Impact of government incentives and subsidies

3. Role of charging infrastructure in adoption

4. Brand ambassador recommendation

5. Manufacturing location assessment

6. Strategic recommendations for AtliQ Motors

## Key Insights

1. India’s EV market is in a hyper-growth phase, led by 2-wheelers (~90% of volumes)

2. 4-wheelers show faster growth, driven by premiumization and value capture

3. EV adoption is highly state-driven, requiring geographic prioritization

4. Market structure differs sharply: fragmented 2W vs concentrated 4W

5. Phased entry reduces capital risk while building long-term capabilities

## Strategic Recommendations

1. Enter India with a 2W-led scale strategy for near-term volume

2. Build capabilities for selective, mid-premium 4W EV entry

3. Prioritize high-potential states balancing scale and growth

4. Establish manufacturing in Tamil Nadu for ecosystem depth and export access

5. Strengthen partnerships across charging, financing, and after-sales ecosystem

## Tools & Technologies Used

1. Power BI – Interactive dashboard & visual storytelling

2. Power Query & DAX – Data cleaning & calculations

3. PowerPoint – McKinsey-style executive presentation

4. Secondary Research – McKinsey, Deloitte, MoRTH, policy reports
